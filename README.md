Cryptographic Failures – Software Quality Assurance Project
Overview

    This repository contains an academic project completed as part of the Software Quality Assurance module. The project focuses on cryptographic failures, their root causes, real-world impact, and practical prevention strategies. It analyzes how weaknesses in cryptographic design, implementation, and configuration can compromise system security.

Objectives

    1.Understand common causes of cryptographic failures in real-world systems

    2.Analyze security incidents resulting from weak or misconfigured cryptography

    3.Identify best practices to prevent cryptographic vulnerabilities

    4.Align findings with OWASP Top 10 (A02: Cryptographic Failures)

Topics Covered

    1.Weak or outdated encryption algorithms

    2.Poor cryptographic key management

    3.Implementation errors in cryptographic functions

    4.Lack of encryption and TLS/SSL misconfiguration

    5.Insider threats and inadequate security awareness

    6.Secure encryption standards and defense-in-depth strategies

Real-World Case Studies

    1.Heartbleed Vulnerability (OpenSSL)

    2.Dual EC DRBG Backdoor Controversy

    3.Debian OpenSSL Random Number Generator Bug

    4.WhatsApp End-to-End Encryption Controversy

Concepts & Standards

    1.Cryptographic best practices

    2.Secure key management principles

    3.TLS/SSL security configurations

    4.Password hashing and encryption standards

    5.OWASP Top 10 security risks

Project Type

    Academic Group Project

Module: Software Quality Assurance

Focus Area: Cybersecurity & Secure Software Design

Key Learnings

    Cryptography failures often result from implementation and configuration errors, not weak algorithms alone

    Secure systems require proper key management, testing, and continuous monitoring

    Defense-in-depth is critical for maintaining long-term security
